# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Cat and Dog Image Classification

Project Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project to classify images as cats or dogs. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training. It demonstrates the application of transfer learning using the VGG19 and VGG16 models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We aim to leverage these powerful models to classify pet images accurately with minimal training data.

Features
Preprocessing: Utilizes Keras preprocessing utilities for image data augmentation to enhance the training set with variations.
Transfer Learning: Employs VGG19 and VGG16 as base models, extracting features from cat and dog images without using the top layer, making it suitable for binary classification.
Model Customization: Adds custom dense layers on top of the base models to tailor the network towards our specific binary classification task.
Training and Validation: Implements a fitting process with data generators for efficient memory usage, alongside steps for validating the model's performance.
Evaluation: Includes scripts for evaluating the trained model's accuracy on a separate test set.

Do you know why you use this approach?
Transfer learning significantly reduces the need for a large dataset and computational power. By using pre-trained models like VGG19 and VGG16, we can utilize the learned features from a vast and diverse dataset (ImageNet) and apply them to our specific task, which is relatively simpler. This approach allows us to achieve high accuracy with less training time and fewer data.
